NeoPixelFireflies
=================

Code for simple fireflies-in-a-jar using Adafruit Flora, NeoPixels and Accelerometer. I strung seven pixels together and hid the Flora, lipo battery and accelerometer in the jar lid.

The fireflies glow on and off with a hue picked from a specified range. At any time only MAX_GLOWING_PIXELS out of NUM_PIXELS will be lit.

You can see an example of the results at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOLEo_zldIc
